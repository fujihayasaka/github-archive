  # Top-level configuration options

* `labels` (Array or String): This discussion will automatically receive these labels upon creation. Can be array of labels or comma-delimited string, e.g. "question,shipped"

# Input type configuration options

## Markdown

Markdown blocks contain arbitrary text that a maintainer can add to a template, to provide extra context or guidance to a contributor. Supports Markdown formatting. This text will **not be rendered in the submitted discussion body**.

**Required Fields**
* `value` (String): The text that will be rendered. Markdown formatting is supported.

_Tip #1: YAML processing will cause the hash symbol to be treated as a comment. To insert Markdown headers, wrap your text in quotes._

_Tip #2: For multi-line text, you can use the pipe operator._

### Example

```yaml
body:
- type: markdown
  value: "## Welcome!"
- type: markdown
  attributes:
    value: |
      Thanks for taking the time to start a new discussion! If you need real-time help, join us on Discord.
```

## Input

Inputs are single-line form input fields. Contributors may use markdown formatting in their responses.

**Required Attributes**
* `label` (String): A brief description of the expected user input.

**Optional Attributes**
* `description` (String): Extra context or guidance about filling out this form input. Supports Markdown.
* `placeholder` (String): Renders as semi-transparent "placeholder" element in the input field when it's empty.
* `value` (String): Default text that is pre-populated in the input field.

**ID**
* `id` (String): Optional unique identifier. Can only contain alphanumeric characters, `-`, and `_`.

**Validations**
* `required` (Boolean): If `true`, the form will not be submittable until this is filled out.

### Example

```yaml
body:
- type: input
  id: suggestion
  attributes:
    label: Suggestion
    description: "How might we make this project better?"
    placeholder: "Adding a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file would be a great idea."
  validations:
    required: true
```

## Textarea

Very similar to inputs, textareas are multiple-line form input fields. Typically used if you'd like a contributor to provide an answer longer than a few words. Contributors may use markdown formatting in their responses.

**Required Attributes**
* `label` (String): A brief description of the expected user input.

**Optional Attributes**
* `description` (String): Extra context or guidance about filling out this form input. Supports Markdown.
* `placeholder` (String): Renders as semi-transparent "placeholder" element in the input field when it's empty.
* `value` (String): Default text that is pre-populated in the input field.
* `render` (String): If a value is provided, user-submitted text will be formatted into a codeblock automatically.

**ID**
* `id` (String): Optional unique identifier. Can only contain alphanumeric characters, `-`, and `_`.

**Validations**
* `required` (Boolean): If `true`, the form will not be submittable until this is filled out.

### Example

```yaml
body:
- type: textarea
  id: improvements
  attributes:
    label: Top 3 improvements
    description: "What are the top 3 improvements we could make to this project?"
    value: |
      1.
      2.
      3.
      ...
    render: bash
  validations:
    required: true
```

## Dropdown

Users can select their answer from options defined by the maintainer.

**Required Attributes**
* `label` (String): A brief description of the expected user input.
* `options` (String Array): Set of values that user can select from to answer. Cannot be empty, and all choices must be distinct.

**Optional Attributes**
* `description` (String): Extra context or guidance about filling out this form input. Supports Markdown.
* `multiple` (Boolean): If `true`, users can submit multiple selections.

**ID**
* `id` (String): Optional unique identifier. Can only contain alphanumeric characters, `-`, and `_`.

**Validations**
* `required` (Boolean): If `true`, the form will not be submittable until at least one choice is selected.

### Example

```yaml
body:
- type: dropdown
  id: download
  attributes:
    label: Which area of this project could be most improved?
    options:
      - Documentation
      - Pull request review time
      - Bug fix time
      - Release cadence
  validations:
    required: true
```

## Checkboxes

A group of one or more checkboxes. This will be saved as a Markdown checkbox, and will continue to support interactive updating.

**Required Attributes**
* `options` (Array): Set of values that user can select from to answer. Cannot be empty. Each item must have a `label`, described below.

**Optional Attributes**
* `label` (String): A brief description of the expected user input.
* `description` (String): Extra context or guidance about filling out this form input. Supports Markdown.

**ID**
* `id` (String): Optional unique identifier. Can only contain alphanumeric characters, `-`, and `_`.

Within each item in `options`, the following fields are supported:

**Required**
* `label` (String): The text that will appear beside the checkbox. Markdown is supported for bold or italic text formatting, and hyperlinks.

**Optional**
* `required` (Boolean): If required, the form will not be submittable unless checked.

    label: What kinds of cats do you like?
    description: You may select more than one.
    options:
